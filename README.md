# CodingChallenge_AMC

This is the coding challenge developed by Antonio Mu√±oz Casado in response to the invitation from Zooplus.

- In order to generate the war, first set the proper configuration in the configuration files: application.properties and persistence.properties. Once done that, just call to maven plugin: mvn war:war

- The application is deployed in Heroku via URL: http://fast-citadel-49071.herokuapp.com/

- Automated build and tests are run in Travis-ci: https://travis-ci.org/anmuca/CodingChallenge_AMC

- In order to check if the application is working, a URL has been configured: http://fast-citadel-49071.herokuapp.com/status
